# synapticle

*(This is a work in progress (pre-alpha). You might find some stable(ish) tagged commits and a [demo](http://anttihalla.fi/static/apps/synapticle/index.html))* 

Tickle your brain with information, reinforce your memory, collide ideas. 

* Review your notes
* Preview text materials
* Generate new ideas

I use *mind maps* as my primary tool for organizing myself, taking notes, brainstorming, outlining etc. As great as they are, I cannot do *everything* with them. *Synapticle* is an attempt to complement those mind maps in computer assisted thinking. 

This project tries, among other things, to answer the following questions:
* How to speed up my learning process? (tools for simple and easy preview and review)
* How to make stronger (synaptic) connections between my different interests (share and mix knowledge between different contexts)
* How to introduce randomness to my thinking process? (I haven't yet found a way to think randomly without the help of an external device)
